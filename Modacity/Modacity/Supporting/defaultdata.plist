					<string>If you can name it you can tame it.

Consider writing fun, empowering names like "Scales - Fluent" instead of just "Scales".

You may break songs into components like "Autumn Leaves - Chords" and "Autumn Leaves - Soloing".

Classical musicians, break your bigger pieces into chunks like "K.417 - Exposition", and also define an item for the entire performance like "K. 417 - Friendly, Accurate Performance"</string>

Details gives you access to that item's statistics, recordings, notes, and history.

Duplicate is great for quickly creating related items like "Arpeggios - Major", "Arpeggios - Minor", "Arpeggios - Whole Tone", etc.

Delete removes a practice item from your data and saved practice sessions, but all practice history remains</string>

					<string>Consider some possibilities...

Create practice sessions for each day of the week, assigning themes to each day. Use numbers to force ordering.

E.g.,
 "1 - Monday - Physical Ease",
 "2 - Tuesday - Dynamics", etc.

Use the "Duplicate Session" feature with date-stamped sessions to plan and calendar similar days' practice.

Set up a technical exercises session contaning all your technique in one place. Use shake to shuffle and just work 20 minutes of random technique each day.

Create a whole session for a single piece of music. Define related items (using duplicate item) for multiple aspects or sections of the music, and sequence them onto your session.</string>

					<string>Practice Strategies</string>
					<key>subtitle</key>
					<string>Generally speaking, set up a practice rhythm of "perform, listen, reflect, improve". Modacity makes this super easy.

If you are learning a new piece, consider working from the back to the front. It helps create comfort.

Transform all negativity into constructive thought or action. "My intonation sucks" is an example of destructive thinking. If such a thought arises, transform it to the nearest positive neighbor, such as "I value intonation and am working to improve it now".

Nobody is perfect. Don't strive for perfection, strive for authenticity, flow, and fully engaged musicianship</string>

					<string>Getting over resistance to recording</string>
					<key>subtitle</key>
					<string>It's natural to feel resistant to recording and listening to yourself.

And, it's incredibly important to get over it.

You cannot practice well without fully listening to yourself! Taking time to listen is easy on the body, good for the mind, and creates overall faster progress. It also teaches you to appreciate yourself and listen constructively.

Time spent self-recording is time well spent.

Choose to get over any hesitations and just do it!</string>
